Is Wall Street Ready? [https://www.thedailyupside.com/advisor/financial-planning/money-managers-appealing-to-women/?hash=9b239ed04c58506f8ff45998264a8c1c]       Photo illustration by Connor Lin / The Daily Upside, Photo by Feedough via iStock\nIts a womans world. Or at least it will be once trillions of dollars change hands over the next two decades amid whats been dubbed the great wealth transfer.\nYouve likely heard about this historic passing of $124 trillion through 2048, with roughly $106 trillion bequeathed from mainly baby boomers to Gen X, millennials and Gen Z (and the rest headed to charities). But the new normal Wall Street needs to prepare for is one in which women control more money than they ever have before: $47 trillion of the $124 trillion is projected to be inherited by young women, according to  Cerulli Associates [https://www.cerulli.com/press-releases/54-trillion-will-transfer-to-widows-through-2048-more-than-95-will-go-to-women]. Meanwhile, more than 95% of the $54 trillion headed to the pockets of surviving spouses is expected to go to women.\nExperts say that the shift requires the financial advisory industry to examine its ability  or lack thereof  to accommodate the goals, lifestyles and preferences of women holding the purse strings.\nTheres a reason that women are investing less. Theres a reason that were not engaging with our advisors in the same way. Theres a reason that the majority of women who make over $250,000 a year dont feel secure with their money, says Emily Green, head of wealth management at Ellevest, a financial advisory firm tailored to women. The only answer to that is that the financial industry is not serving them.\nBut thats changing.\nInflux of Opportunities\nDespite women controlling roughly a third of retail financial assets in the US and Europe, a number expected to grow to 40-45% by 2030, affluent women are much less likely to work with a professional advisor than their male counterparts, according to  McKinsey [https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/financial-services/our-insights/the-new-face-of-wealth-the-rise-of-the-female-investor]. Thats because while firms will often talk the talk (launch campaigns or events targeting female clients), they havent been willing to walk the walk (actually change their offerings or how they work with clients). Now, theyre learning that they have to.\nIts no secret that Wall Street is male-dominated and always has been, and the same goes for the people behind the scenes helping investors manage their money. Of the roughly 106,000  certified financial planners [https://www.cfp.net/industry-insights/reports-and-statistics/professional-demographics] (CFPs) working today, 76.2% are male.\nAttracting more women clients requires advisory firms to reconsider whether their workforce reflects the demographic that theyre looking to serve, says Alex Roca, host of Fidelity Investments Women Talk Money community and a former financial consultant at Fidelity.\nNot only are we going to see an influx of opportunities because women are inheriting money, she adds, but also because there are going to be more opportunities in the workforce to reflect that transfer of wealth.\nDitch the Pink\nAdvisors attempting to attract more women is by no means a new phenomenon, which just goes to show how ineffective some approaches have been.\nTheres a mismatch between what half the population is asking for and what tens of thousands of companies are delivering on the other side, Green says. At first, people were thinking if we talk about work-life balance or make things pink, itll work. Its a lot more than that.\nSallie Krawcheck co-founded Ellevest 11 years ago to bridge the gender gap, which required formulating investment strategies that prioritize what women actually care about, such as a values-aligned approach. (S&P  found [https://www.spglobal.com/content/dam/spglobal/corporate/en/images/general/papers/241755-global_womens_investor_survey_paper_8.5x11_digital_final.pdf] that women generally prioritize a companys stance on environmental and social issues more highly than men when making investment decisions.)\nAnd Green says that while financial planning has often been framed as squeezing the last dollar out of every decision so that you die with the most money possible, many women are simply trying to live the most fruitful life possible. Thats why Ellevest emphasizes what Green calls values mapping  aligning investing decisions with goals, such as early retirement or even moving to a higher-tax state if it will make them happy. Advisors also need to account for the fact that women tend to live longer than men, which could mean paying more for long-term care or health care later in life.\nEllevest regularly collects data on what women are currently concerned about, and over the past two years, Green says interest in managing the finances of widowhood, inheritance and divorce has risen as the wealth transfer gets underway.\nListen and Learn\nWhen financial planner Carla Adams opened her firm, Ametrine Wealth, in 2023, she received a note from a former client asking if she could return to working with Adams. The clients new male advisor, whom she began working with after a move, didnt listen to her. Adams, whos based in Lake Orion, Michigan, and designed her firm to better serve women, said its not uncommon for women to feel unheard when seeking financial advice.\nThey dont want to be talked down to, rushed through decisions or have assumptions made about what they do or dont know, Adams says.\nNearly a quarter of respondents to a recent survey from the  CFP Board [https://www.cfp.net/-/media/files/cfp-board/knowledge/reports-and-research/womens-initiative/building-wealth-insights-on-womens-aspirations-growing-financial-power.pdf] said women rank the ability to find suitable financial solutions to a clients specific challenges as the most important quality in an advisor. But being able to share complex financial topics simply and effectively, making the client feel comfortable and listening without judgment were each listed as important qualities by more than 90% of respondents.\nMuch of financial planning is similar when you talk to men and women: Both are looking to save for goals like retirement and their childrens education, Roca says. Its how you talk about the planning that is different.\nSometimes men will be more aggressive. Theyll think about the growth, theyll think about investments, theyll think about taking risk and taking more risk to make their money grow, she adds. (A  study [https://www.jpmorgan.com/content/dam/jpmorgan/documents/wealth-management/diverse-investor-study-2024.pdf] published by J.P. Morgan Wealth Management last year found that 77% of women say they use a risk-averse strategy compared with just 58% of men.) Women tend to be a little more conservative and savings-leaning  its about wanting to get them to make their money work just as hard as they do, Roca says.\nAnd amid the wealth transfer, managers could have a lot more of that money to put to work.\nWritten by Mallika Mitra\nPRESENTED BY FISHER INVESTMENTS [https://www.fisherinvestments.com/en-us/campaigns/tewm/vh?PC=TDUAA28E28&CC=0GOH&utm_source=TheDailyUpside]    Unlock Your Wealths Full Potential [https://www.fisherinvestments.com/en-us/campaigns/tewm/vh?PC=TDUAA28E28&CC=0GOH&utm_source=TheDailyUpside]        Photo via Fisher Investments\nSignificant wealth comes with tax complexities  managing them requires a sophisticated approach.\nFisher Investments Tax-Efficient Wealth Management for Affluent Investors [https://www.fisherinvestments.com/en-us/campaigns/tewm/vh?PC=TDUAA28E28&CC=0GOH&utm_source=TheDailyUpside] offers essential financial planning insights for high-net-worth investors.\nInside, youll learn ways to:\nImplement a tax-aware portfolio strategy.

In todays special edition, youll learn how holiday movies have come to dominate pop culture in the month of Decemberfrom Hallmarks rise as a Christmas juggernaut to why its a great time to be a Canadian former child star. Read on for everything you ever wanted to know about the holiday movie industrial complex.\nTV\nHow Hallmark became a Christmas colossus\nTibrina Hobson/Getty Images for Hallmark Media\nWere not sure what was more unbelievable when brothers Joyce and Rollie Hall got into the stationery business more than a century agothat their company would later run one of the most-watched TV channels in the US, or that it would be responsible for so many Christmas movies starring DJ from\nFull House\n. Either way, the companys origins were so humble that they couldve inspiredtheir own Hallmark Channel movie.\nFade in:\nIn the 1910s, in Kansas City, Missouri, a Methodist ministers sons began selling greeting cards that became especially popular among World War I servicemen and families. In the ensuing decades, the Hall brothers invented modern wrapping paper, struck partnerships with Disney and artist Norman Rockwell, and hosted some radio shows before wading deeper into showbiz.\nDear Fellows: Were going to try our hand at television,\nJoyce Hall\nwrote\nto his sales team in 1951, according to the New Yorker. Hallmark sponsored the worlds first written-for-TV opera that year and never looked back:\nAfter sponsoring other peoples productions for a few decades, Hallmark formed an entertainment arm in 1991 and later bought a stake in the religious cable network Odyssey.\nHallmark absorbed Odyssey in 2001 and renamed it the Hallmark Channel, a new frontier for church-friendly family dramas.\nUpon the smash success of its 2006 flick\nThe Christmas Card\n, Hallmark went full Yuletide mode and launched its annual Countdown to Christmas event in 2009.\nIts 2014 movie\nChristmas Under Wraps\n, starring former\nFull House\nstar Candace Cameron Bure, was another breakthrough for the Hallmark Channel, former CEO Bill Abbott told the New Yorker in 2019. The company continued to cast former teen icons, including 2000s heartthrobs Chad Michael Murray and Jesse Metcalfe, to draw in younger viewers.\nNow\nHallmarks catalog of 300+ Christmas movies gives it an edge as cable TV in general declinesthe Hallmark Channel was the\nmost-watched\nentertainment cable network in the US in 2024. This quarter, its poised to be the most popular one among US women for the 12th straight year. But viewership is still eroding: 36 million people watched a Hallmark movie during the holidays last year, compared to 80+ million viewers in 2021, according to Nielsen data.\nHallmarks formula:\nServe up familiar, family-friendly, politics-free fun, according to Abbott, though most of Hallmarks characters have historically been straight, white, and Christian. In 2020, Abbott stepped down after\npulling\na commercial that featured a lesbian couple. Following that PR crisis, the Hallmark Channel sought to diversify its programming, debuting its first Christmas rom-com with gay lead characters in 2022. That year, Bure\nleft\nHallmark for Great American Family, a smaller network that she said would keep traditional marriage at the core, in an interview with the Wall Street Journal Magazine.\nML\nPresented By Fisher Investments\n9 reasons to reconsider buying an annuity\nAnnuities are often marketed as low-risk ways to achieve your long-term goals, but have you looked closely at whats in the fine print?

Netflix, of course. The streaming giant has bulked up its library with Christmas content to make sure jingle bells dont drown out that tudum sound.\nSnowball effect:\nNetflix released its first fully festive original movie,\nA Christmas Prince\n, in 2017. Now, it has dozens of holiday movies, including two additional\nChristmas Prince\ninstallments.\nLast years hit rom-com,\nHot Frosty\n, was Netflixs No.1 movie for a spell.\nAnd this year, several newcomers (\nMy Secret Santa\n,\nJingle Bell Heist\n, and\nChampagne Problems\n) have been shoulder-to-shoulder with nonseasonal content at the top of the Netflix leaderboard.\nThe streamer also has plenty of holiday specials and several themed\nvirtual fireplaces\nto warm up your home, figuratively speaking.\nSharing Hallmarks crown:\nIn addition to streaming its own movies, Netflix also partners with Hallmark for some content. Last year, Netflix added 10 Hallmark productions to its holiday lineup, and this year, the two signed a multiyear\nlicensing agreement\n.\nIts not just Netflix.\nThe Great American Family network (formerly known as GAC Family) has found similar inspiration, scooping up Hallmark veterans like Candace Cameron Bure and Lori Loughlin to star in holiday fare. This years Great American Christmas programming kicked off in October and will run through January 1.\nBC\nTogether With Starbucks\nBenefits: just the start.\nAt\nStarbucks\n, full- and part-time partners get comprehensive healthcare benefits, including dental, vision, and mental healthcare.

The formula? Combine a ~$2 million budget, a predictable plotline, and a portfolio of greeting-card-looking actors into a beloved classic.\nThe story.\nYou probably could have guessed, but almost all of Hallmarks holiday movies are about Christmas. (In one film, characters celebrate Christmas and Kwanzaa.) The network didnt make its first Hanukkah movie until 2019, and it wasnt until 2023s\nRound and Round\nthat most Hallmark-heads would say the channel made a\ngood\nHanukkah movie. Additionally, a 2023 analysis of Hallmark movies by the New York Times found that:\n40% of films since 2017 begin with a woman traveling to a small town.\n20% of the men in the movies are single fathers, a statistic much higher than the actual number of single dads in the US.\nThe actors.\nHallmark usually casts leading roles from within its own ecosystem, meaning you see a lot of familiar faces trying to save the local inn or host a royal ball. The most iconic Christmas queen is\nLacey Chabert\n, who has starred in over 40 made-for-TV holiday movies for the channel. Other recognizable names include Aaron Tveit and Tamera Mowry-Housley.\nIts a relatively stable gig for actors in a wildly unstable industry. Most Hallmark movies take just 15 days each to film in the summer, have light subject matter, and can easily net\n$150,000\nfor even the less-famous lead actors.\nMM\nTogether With Brass Monkey\nAre you game?\nIf your party needs more pizzazz, turn to the game aficionados over at Brass Monkey.

Over half of Hallmarks holiday movies are produced in Canada, including several of the 24 cinematic masterpieces it is putting out this season.\nCanuck Christmas\nAside from its wintry weather and status as a spruce superpower, Americas Northern neighbor has every other ingredient for\ncooking up\nholiday cinemagic on the cheap. There are varied settings for mimicking stateside locales and a deep bench of film and production talent. Several local production companies supply Hallmark with filmmaking support.\nBut the countrys generous production tax benefits are the real stocking-stuffer for the Christmas movie industrial complex:\nCanadas national government offers a tax rebate of up to 25% for wages paid to local talent.\nBritish Columbia, a particularly popular holiday filming location, offers an additional 40% tax credit, which stacks on top of the federal incentives.\nThe Canadian Christmas dollars come with a big caveat: They can be claimed in full only if the faces gracing living room TV screens around the holidays belong to Canadian passport-holders. Ryan Gosling has so far appeared in zero Hallmark holiday movies, but the Montreal-born\nA Bride for Christmas\nheadliner, Andrew Walker, has starred in more than 10.\nCanada doesnt have a monopoly on Christmas movies\nwith upstate New York and Connecticut also serving as popular holiday filming hubs.
