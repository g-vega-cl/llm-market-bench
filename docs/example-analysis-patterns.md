# Analysis Patterns
Usually we can use the same patterns of analysis and context to make predictions, here are some examples:

## Ratios.
* Ratios like the gold/silver ratio can show relative value between related assets. When the ratio is historically high, silver may be undervalued relative to gold, and vice versa. Similar patterns exist in other commodity pairs (copper/gold, oil/natural gas), equity indices (small cap/large cap), and market indicators (put/call ratios, VIX/market levels).

## Adjacent Industries.
* When AI started to trend, the first companies to benefit were the ones directly related to it, like semiconductor companies. But then it spread to other industries -> like energy and infrastructure ->  then to commodities like copper -> then to RAM, datacenter cooling, etc...
Finding the next adjacent industry is key to making predictions and capitalizing on them.
