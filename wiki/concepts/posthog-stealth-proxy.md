# PostHog Stealth Proxy

A three-layer same-origin reverse proxy architecture that prevents browser ad blockers from blocking PostHog analytics by routing all client-side telemetry through `/p` on the application's own domain.

## Problem

Browser extensions and privacy-focused browsers commonly block requests to known analytics domains like `us.i.posthog.com` and `us-assets.i.posthog.com`. This causes loss of product analytics, error tracking, and session recordings in production.

## Solution: Three-Layer Architecture

### Layer 1: Client Configuration

The `PostHogProvider` in `__root.tsx` uses `api_host: '/p'` (relative path) instead of the full PostHog URL. This ensures all SDK requests go to the same origin as the app.

### Layer 2: Local Development Proxy

`vite.config.ts` proxies paths under `/p` to the appropriate PostHog endpoints:
- `/p/static/*` → `https://us-assets.i.posthog.com/static/*` (asset ingestion)
- `/p/array/*` → `https://us-assets.i.posthog.com/array/*` (event arrays)
- `/p/*` → `https://us.i.posthog.com/*` (API requests)

Each proxy rule uses `changeOrigin: true` and `secure: false` for seamless forwarding.

### Layer 3: Production Edge Proxy

`netlify.toml` defines Netlify Edge CDN redirects with `status=200` (server-side rewrite) for the same path patterns. These are invisible to the browser and cannot be blocked by client-side extensions.

### Server-Side Exception

Server-side tracking (`posthog-server.ts`) connects directly to `https://us.i.posthog.com` without the proxy, since server-to-server traffic runs in Netlify Functions and is immune to ad blockers.

## Testing

A Vitest unit test in `-__root.test.tsx` mocks the PostHogProvider and verifies that `options.api_host` is set to `'/p'` when rendered on the client.
